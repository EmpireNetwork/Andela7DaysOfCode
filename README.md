## About the project

Its a project written with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It lets users make drawings using table cell grids by coloring them.
Upon entry, the user is presented with a form from which they can dynamically set the width and height of the table from which they will draw. Once sumbitted, the table is drawn with selected width and height. When any cell of the table is clicked on, it becomes colored with the current value of the color picker, when a colored cell is click on, its color is removed. To change the color, the user would have to click on the color picker and select another color.
